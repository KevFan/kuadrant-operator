# Configure Observability of Gateway and Kuadrant components

## Overview

This guide includes steps to enable the Kuadrant observability feature.
This feature provides an integration between the Kuadrant components (including any gateways) and the [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator) if you have it installed in your cluster. The feature works by creating a set of ServiceMonitors and PodMonitors, which instruct prometheus to scrape metrics from the Kuadrant and Gateway components.
The scraped metrics are used in the [Example Dashboards and Alerts](../../observability/examples.md).

## Prerequisites

- You have installed Kuadrant in a Kubernetes cluster.
- You have installed the [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator).

## Enabling Observability

To enable observability for Kuadrant and any gateways, set `enable: true` under the `observability` section in your Kuadrant CR.
When enabled, Kuadrant creates ServiceMonitors and PodMonitors for its own components and in each gateway namespace (Envoy Gateway or Istio).

```yaml
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1beta1
kind: Kuadrant
metadata:
  name: kuadrant-sample
spec:
  observability:
    enable: true
```

You can check all created monitors using this command:

```yaml
kubectl get servicemonitor,podmonitor -A -l kuadrant-observability=true
```

If you decide the default monitors arenâ€™t suitable, disable the feature by setting `enable: false` and create your own ServiceMonitor/PodMonitor definitions or configure Prometheus directly.
For more information about some of the different metrics available, check out the [Metrics reference page](../../observability/metrics.md).
